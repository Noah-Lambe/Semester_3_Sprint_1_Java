# Development Standards

To ensure consistency and maintainability, the following development standards should be adhered to:

## Code Formatting
- Use **tabs** for indentation.

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: Use **PascalCase** (e.g., `MedicationTracking`).
- **Methods and Variables**: Use **camelCase** (e.g., `addANewPatient`).

## Code Comments
- Provide clear comments explaining:
  - Complex logic.
  - Method behavior.
  - Any assumptions made in the code.

## Separation of Concerns
- Each class should be responsible for a single concern. For example:
  - A `Patient` class should only handle patient-related logic.

## Error Handling
- Handle all possible exceptions appropriately.
- Ensure meaningful error messages are provided to the user.
